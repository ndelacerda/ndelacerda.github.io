I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I hold an M.A in Sociology from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and an M.A in Political Science from UNC-Chapel Hill. 

My research focuses on political psychology, public opinion, and political parties from a comparative perspective. I study how institutional and political contexts shape the way individuals define and perceive themselves politically. My research has been published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13540688221090604"> Party Politics</a>, the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1866802X211069378"> Journal of Politics in Latin America</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-research-review/article/ideological-preferences-and-evolution-of-the-religious-cleavage-in-chile-19982014/595F537E6D72FE5FE8D434D9D975172A"> Latin American Research Review</a>.

I also coordinate (with <a href="https://hartlyn.web.unc.edu/">Jonathan Hartlyn</a> and <a href="https://ceciliamg.web.unc.edu/">Cecilia Martínez-Gallardo</a>) the Chapel Hill Expert Survey - Latin America (CHES-LA). The first wave, conducted in 2020, asked 160 experts to place 112 political parties and 13 presidents on an extensive set of issue and dimensions. The data can be accessed <a href="https://www.chesdata.eu/chesla">here</a>.
