## The Case for Non-Partisan Political Cueing: Experimental Evidence from Peru

<i>Invited to revise and resubmit at Political Behavior<i>.

<u>Abstract</u>: Citizens infer policy information from partisan cues, yet their utility varies cross-nationally. In weakly institutionalized democracies with short-lived political parties and volatile party systems, partisan cues are likely of little heuristic value. I argue that in these contexts, citizens leverage alternative political markers, such as ideological or political movement-related categories, to make sense of the political arena. I test this argument in Peru, a country with an extremely volatile and distrusted party system. Using a survey experiment, I show that political cues significantly influence policy preferences even in the absence of clear and strong partisan brands. Further analysis using causal forest reveals that movement-related political identities are the primary moderators of cueing effects, outweighing traditional factors such as partisanship or ideology. Notably, while non-partisan cues influence attitude formation, only outgroup cues effectively shape preferences. I theorize that these patterns stem from deep levels of mistrust with political institutions, a common feature of less institutionalized democracies. These findings suggest that the nature of political cueing in such contexts differs markedly from established democracies. Overall, this study underscores the importance of alternative forms of political identification in weakly institutionalized party systems, extending existing theories of public opinion formation to diverse democratic settings.

## A Global Scale of Economic Left-Right Party Positions: Exploring the Cross-National and Cross-Expert Perceptions of Party Placements 

**with Ryan Bakker, Ruth Dassonneville, Seth Jolly, Jelle Koedam, Patrick Leslie, Jonathan Polk, Jill Sheppard, and Roi Zur** 

<i>Invited to revise and resubmit at the Journal of Politics<i>.

<u>Abstract</u>: We examine the cross-national comparability of expert placements of political parties on the economic left-right dimension using a novel data set that combines data from Europe, Latin America, Australia, Israel, Canada, and the United States. Using anchoring vignettes and Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling (BAM), we evaluate whether there is evidence of geographic or expert-level differential item functioning (DIF), in terms of how experts perceive party placements on an economic left-right dimension. We then explore systematic differences across experts’ perceptual distortion parameters (DIF “shift” and “stretch” terms) using Bayesian Multilevel Regression Models. The models show that there are no substantively interesting systematic biases in perceptions of party placements for either term at the region, country, or expert level. More generally, our results clearly support the claim that the economic left-right dimension travels well across the globe.

## Affect, Not Ideology The Psychological Mechanisms of Partisan Information Processing 

**with Sam Fuller and Jack T. Rametta** 

<i>Invited to revise and resubmit at Political Behavior<i>.

<u>Abstract</u>: In this paper we evaluate the extent to which partisan bias is driven by affect or ideology by theorizing and testing the underpinnings of each of these potential mechanisms. We theorize that partisan bias can be an outcome of two different information processing channels: motivated bias and affect transfer. While motivated bias arises from the tendency to accept information that is consistent with the one stored in memory, affect transfer charges information affectively depending on the characteristics of the messenger. Using a survey experiment designed to disentangle these two mechanisms and a method designed to detect treatment effect heterogeneity and calculate conditional treatment effects (Causal Forest), we find that affect plays a much more important role than ideology in moderating the effect of partisan cues on information processing. This finding contributes to the literature by adding to our understanding of the psychological underpinnings behind partisan bias.

## Beyond Partisanship: Theory and Methods

<i>Under review.<i>

<u>Abstract</u>: Partisan identities powerfully shape mass political behavior in established democracies, yet comparative evidence suggests they play a more limited role in developing nations. While scholars recognize that alternative political attachments can anchor voter behavior in these contexts, existing research lacks theoretical and methodological tools to study them systematically. This article addresses these limitations by developing the Political Identities Profiles (PIP) framework, which provides theoretical and empirical tools for identifying and examining political identities across national contexts. Using original survey data from Latin America, this study makes three contributions to our understanding of comparative political behavior. First, it provides a theoretical framework that enables systematic identification and measurement of distinct political identities beyond partisanship. Second, it introduces validation techniques to assess the distinctiveness, relevance, and cross-national comparability of diverse forms of identification. Third, it provides evidence of the importance of alternative forms of political identification in contexts where partisanship is weak.


## To blur or not to blur: Disentangling populist ideology and electoral strategy in Europe and Latin America

**with Jacob Gunderson**

<i>Under review.<i>

<u>Abstract</u>: Studies of populism in Western Europe associate it with blurred or vague economic positions. But how integral is this strategy for populism outside West European democracies? This paper leverages a comparison between Latin America and Europe to argue that populists tailor their strategies to their competitive context, focusing on party system dimensionality and host ideologies as moderators. We validate new measures of positional blurring from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey to evaluate regional differences in positional blurring by populists and to directly test our moderators across these two regions. We find that populists blur their economic positions in multidimensional systems and when they adopt exclusionary thick ideologies, two characteristics of European populism. In Latin America, where politics is unidimensional and populism is generally inclusive, populists present clear, not blurred, positions. These findings have implications for the study of populism as a global phenomenon and parties’ adaptation to contextual factors.



## Beyond an Instrumental Exchange: Political Affects and Clientelist Compliance in Contemporary Mexico

**with Rodrigo Castro Cornejo**

<i>Presented at the American Political Science Association 2024 Annual Conference, Philadelphia<i>.

<u>Abstract</u>: While clientelist exchanges are typically analyzed from an instrumental perspective, we propose a new theory of affective commitments and argue that gift-giving can transcend utilitarian considerations, increase expressive attitudes towards political parties, shape partisan loyalties, and foster commitment to patron-client relationships. Identifying the effect of clientelism on citizens’ expressive considerations is particularly challenging because political parties often target loyal voters and voters tend to misreport these interactions. We overcome these challenges using a three-part strategy. First, we leverage a three-wave panel study that allows us to identify the effect of clientelism on affects, partisanship, and vote choice, controlling for political machines’ pre-existing patterns of resource allocation. Second, using a mediation analysis, we assess whether affects can increase commitment to patron-client relationships. Finally, we use a survey experiment to evaluate the plausibility of the proposed mechanisms and address issues of misreporting. Without denying the crucial role that instrumental considerations have in clientelist exchanges, our findings suggest that affective channels play a role in solving commitment issues in patron-client relationships. 

## Political Identities and Belief Networks in Developing Democracies

<i>Presented at the American Political Science Association 2023 Annual Conference, Los Angeles.<i>

<u>Abstract</u>: Research in developed democracies suggests that belief networks are structured around political identities. However, we know much less about how belief networks are organized in places with less democratic experience and volatile party systems. Political elites play a key role in structuring belief systems by organizing belief packages and signaling to voters which ideas “ought to be together”. Accordingly, belief systems in less organized party systems can potentially systematically differ from those in highly institutionalized democracies. Building on the social identity perspective (SIP), I argue that political identities play a fundamental role in shaping political belief networks, even in contexts where party competition is less institutionalized. Using data from Chile and Peru and Mixed Graphical Models (MGNs), I show how ideological and political movement markers, as well as partisan ones, play an important role in structuring belief systems. Findings underscore the relevance of alternative forms of political identification, beyond partisanship, in less institutionalized democracies.

## Programmatic and Non-Programmatic Party System Structuration in Latin America

**with Jonathan Hartlyn and Cecilia Martínez-Gallardo**

<i>Presented at the American Political Science Association 2023 Annual Conference, Los Angeles.<i>

<u>Abstract</u>: This paper evaluates the extent to which political parties in contemporary Latin America compete by offering voters distinct policy programs, and the degree to which they rely on alternative, non-programmatic appeals. Using data from CHES-LA, a recent expert survey of party positions in the region, we employ confirmatory factor analysis to show that political parties compete for voters using a mix of programmatic and non-programmatic appeals. We demonstrate that populism and particularism, though related, are two different non-programmatic dimensions, and that they interact in systematic ways with the programmatic dimension. While programmatically polarized parties tend to rely on populist appeals, centrist and right-wing parties are more likely to favor particularism. More generally, we provide a comprehensive view of party competition in the region.

## Partisan Profiles in Democracies and Non-Democracies: Evidence from 101 Countries

**with Courtney Blackington**

<i>Presented at the Southern Political Association 2021 Annual Meeting, Virtual.<i>

<u>Abstract</u>: Though previous research consistently highlights the role of partisanship in democracies, we know less about partisans in non-democracies. Do levels of democracy shape the formation of partisan identities, and how do these partisan identities impact attitudes towards political institutions in different regimes? We theorize that levels of democracy shape both who identifies as regime or opposition-party partisans and whether partisans trust political institutions. Using cross-national data from 101 countries, we find that as levels of democracy decrease, partisans and their attitudes systematically differ. In less democratic countries, ruling-party partisans are less educated and greater in number than their opposition-party partisan counterparts; however, no similar gaps appear in democracies. Moreover, as levels of democracy fall, trust in political institutions polarizes. In democracies, partisans trust political institutions equally. In non-democracies, opposition-party partisans trust political institutions markedly less than ruling-party partisans. We show that democratic backsliding correlates with the emergence of these patterns in Hungary and Nicaragua.
