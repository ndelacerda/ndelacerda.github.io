## Beyond Partisanship: Political Identity Profiles in Latin America.

<u>Abstract</u>: Research on political identities has been dominated by a focus on partisanship. However, it is widely recognized that parties are only one of many political markers with which citizens can identify. I address this gap in the literature by providing a theoretical and empirical framework to study political identification in a comparative perspective. The political identity profiles (PIP) framework proposes that political identities are not bound to partisanship and that context plays a fundamental role in shaping the salience of different forms of political identification. To test this framework, I introduce a multi-item scale tailored to measure different types of political identities. I then provide evidence for the internal and convergent validity of the measures used by focusing on the Latin American case. Results provide strong evidence in favor of the validity of the framework. I conclude by focusing on some of the normative implications of these findings for the study of political behavior and democracy.

## Partisan Profiles in Democracies and Non-Democracies: Evidence from 101 Countries.

**[with Courtney Blackington]**

<u>Abstract</u>: Though previous research consistently highlights the role of partisanship in democracies, we know less about partisans in non-democracies. Do levels of democracy shape the formation of partisan identities, and how do these partisan identities impact attitudes towards political institutions in different regimes? We theorize that levels of democracy shape both who identifies as regime or opposition-party partisans and whether partisans trust political institutions. Using cross-national data from 101 countries, we find that as levels of democracy decrease, partisans and their attitudes systematically differ. In less democratic countries, ruling-party partisans are less educated and greater in number than their opposition-party partisan counterparts; however, no similar gaps appear in democracies. Moreover, as levels of democracy fall, trust in political institutions polarizes. In democracies, partisans trust political institutions equally. In non-democracies, opposition-party partisans trust political institutions markedly less than ruling-party partisans. We show that democratic backsliding correlates with the emergence of these patterns in Hungary and Nicaragua. 

## Are Party Families in Europe Ideologically Coherent Today?

**[with Jacob Gunderson]**

<u>Abstract</u>: Researchers classify political parties into families by their shared cleavage origin. However, as parties have drifted from the original ideological commitments, it is unclear to what extent party families can today function as effective heuristics for shared positions. We propose an alternative way of classifying parties based solely on their ideological positions as one solution to this challenge. We use Model-Based Clustering to recast common subjective decisions involved in the process of creating party groups as problems of model selection, thus, providing non-subjective criteria to define clusters. By comparing canonical families to our ideological clusters, we show that while party families on the right are often too similar to justify categorizing them into different clusters, left-wing families are weakly internally cohesive. Moreover, we get three clusters mostly composed of parties in Eastern Europe, questioning the degree to which categories originally designed to describe Western Europe can generalize to other regions.
